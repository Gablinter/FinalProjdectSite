This is my SoftUni React Project. It's a site that has a Home, About, Products, Testemonials, Contact Us Login And Signup Pages. It also has a cart page which is only visible to logged in users. 
The back end was designed by me using the libraries: 
- express
- bodyParser
- router 
- cookieParser
- cors
And for dataBase I used monoogse;

For the FrontEnd I disigned using React. I also used libraries like: 
- google-map-react
- react-cookie
- react-router-dom
